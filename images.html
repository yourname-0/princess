                            <pre>i know yesterday's my text made u think 
"to stop texting me or disturbing me"

But the thing is, 
"I always crave to speak with you, 
text with you, and be with you!"

I wake up, I think about you
I'm out with friends, I think about you
I'm with family, I think about you
I listen to music, I think about you

so, stop thinking something all.
